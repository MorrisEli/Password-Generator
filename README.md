# Password-Generator
All possible characters are located in the upper, lower, number, and special character arrays.

When selecting the generate button(id = generate, in html.), then you add the event listener. 
When you click on the button, you call the writePassword function. Which calls get prompts.

If prompts return true, the generatePassword function is called.
Then the text value is changed, adn the DOM is updated.
Last, the password is displayed on the page.
